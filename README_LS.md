# Library Management System in C++ (Template-Based)

This is a **console-based Library Management System** developed in **C++** using **class templates** and **linked list**. The system allows management of both **student records** and **book records**, including:

- Insertion  
- Deletion  
- Searching  
- Updating  
- Sorting  
- Administration Menu

This project demonstrates practical use of **data structures** in C++, such as:

- Templates  
- Pointers  
- Linked Lists  
- Object-Oriented Design  
- Menu-driven interfaces
